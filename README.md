# Loan-Approval-Prediction using ANN
Designing a machine learning algorithm using  Artificial Neural Network that would predict the likelihood of a customer getting approved for a bank loan. In the present scenario, a loan needs to be approved manually by a representative of the bank which means that person will be responsible for whether the person is eligible for the loan or not and also calculating the risk associated with it. If the loan is not repaid, then it accounts as a loss to the bank and banks earn most of their profits by the interest paid to them. So it is very important that the loan should be approved with the least amount of error in risk calculation while taking up as the least time possible. So a loan prediction model is required that can predict quickly whether the loan can be passed or not with the least amount of risk possible.
